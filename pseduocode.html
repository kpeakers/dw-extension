Sticker of imgs/gifs on click in body randomly from array
    -- May need to make a clear button as they fill up viewport


Change certain words like you to 'ye' and 'thee' and more like that. 

Maybe have some sounds come about as you click on things, or maybe just when you open a tab, idk. But I might do sounds is the point. 

Background colors array, fantasy-ish


fancy fantasy fonts!!!

modify imgs on pages with my own imgs? idk


body {
       
  background: #0f2027 !important; /* fallback for old browsers */
  background: -webkit-linear-gradient(to right, #0f2027, #203a43, #2c5364) !important;/* Chrome 10-25, Safari 5.1-6 */
