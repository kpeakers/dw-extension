# CHROME EXTENSION

This extension turns your viewport into a fantasy inspired mess. Fonts become handwritten, your viewport's vernacular will adopt some old fantasy-esque jargon, and custom pictures and sounds will bring it to life as well. This probably won't be an extension you keep on for very long, but it can be sort of cool as long as you don't try to read it. Also, fair warning you may want to keep your volume lower rather than higher. RIP headphone users... Features references from: Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Skyrim, and general lore. 

This extension was built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript (with JQuery) for the University of Lethbridge's Dynamic Web course: NMED 3720. As intimidating as it was, and as Javascript remains, I still feel like I learned a lot and might still putz around with this in the future. 

Inspiration for this extension came from extensions like [Cornify](https://www.cornify.com/) , [Yas by Queer Eye](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yas-by-queer-eye/emhcionpgomklidodcncnfncjfeaifoj) , and was brought to fruition from this lovely [tutorial](https://nkhilv.medium.com/how-to-make-a-word-replacement-chrome-extension-17cbd3639db6) (and a lot of help from Christine). 



The font used to create the scrawling text throughout the extension was [this Google Font.](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Dr+Sugiyama?query=dr&category=Handwriting&preview.text_type=custom#standard-styles) 

## Thank you for reading this far, and for the extension, I'm sorry. â˜º
