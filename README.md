# CHROME EXTENSION

This extension turns your viewport into a fantasy inspired mess. Fonts become handwritten, your viewport's vernacular will adopt some old fantasy-esque jargon, and custom pictures and sounds will bring it to life as well. This probably won't be an extension you keep on for very long, but it can be sort of cool as long as you don't try to read it. Features references from: Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Skyrim, and general lore. 

This extension was built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript (with JQuery) for the University of Lethbridge's Dynamic Web course: NMED 3720. 

Inspiration for this extension came from extensions like Cornify (link), Yas by Queer Eye (link), and SMN ELSE HERE, GO INTO MORE INSPIRATION STUFF. MENTION CODE BORROWED?
